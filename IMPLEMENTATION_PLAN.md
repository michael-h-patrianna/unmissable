## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- **Senior Swift Developer** (3 days) - Deadlock fix, performance optimization
- **DevOps Engineer** (4 days) - Code signing, notarization, monitoring
- **Backend Developer** (3 days) - Error handling, production config
- **Technical Writer** (1 day) - Documentation updates
- **QA Engineer** (2 days) - Testing across all phases

### Infrastructure
- **Apple Developer Account** - For code signing certificates
- **macOS Test Devices** - Multiple macOS versions for testing
- **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated build and testing
- **Monitoring Tools** - Basic crash reporting and analytics

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Deadlock Test Crash** - Could indicate underlying threading issues
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough investigation and stress testing
2. **Code Signing Issues** - Could delay distribution
   - **Mitigation**: Early setup and testing on multiple devices

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Apple Notarization Delays** - Apple review process timing
   - **Mitigation**: Submit early, have backup distribution plan
2. **Google API Quota Issues** - Production usage might hit limits
   - **Mitigation**: Request quota increase, implement rate limiting

### Low Risk Items
1. **Performance Regressions** - Optimizations might introduce bugs
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing after each change
2. **User Adoption Issues** - Installation or usage problems
   - **Mitigation**: Clear documentation and support channels
