# Beast PRD - Project File Cleanup Analysis

## Problem Statement

Identify files in the Unmissable macOS project that are no longer needed and could be safely removed to reduce repository bloat and improve maintainability.

## Users & Jobs-to-be-Done

- **Developers**: Need a clean, maintainable codebase without obsolete files
- **Project Maintainers**: Want to reduce repository size and eliminate confusion from outdated files
- **Code Reviewers**: Need clear project structure without deprecated components

## Goals & Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
1. Identify all potentially obsolete files in the project
2. Categorize files by likelihood of being unnecessary
3. Provide rationale for each recommendation
4. Ensure no critical files are incorrectly flagged

### Success Metrics
- Complete inventory of potentially obsolete files
- Clear categorization (definitely obsolete, likely obsolete, uncertain)
- Zero critical files incorrectly identified for removal
- Actionable recommendations with clear rationale

## Scope

### In Scope
- Test files that may be duplicated or obsolete
- Debug/logging files that are temporary artifacts
- Configuration examples or templates
- Unused scripts or utilities
- Old documentation files
- Build artifacts or temporary files

### Out of Scope
- Core application source code
- Active test suites
- Required configuration files
- Build system files (Package.swift, etc.)
- Documentation that's still relevant

## Functional Requirements

### File Analysis
- Scan entire project structure
- Identify file types and purposes
- Check for usage references in codebase
- Categorize by obsolescence likelihood

### Reporting
- Provide comprehensive list of potentially obsolete files
- Include rationale for each recommendation
- Categorize by confidence level (high/medium/low risk of removal)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Accuracy
- Zero false positives for critical files
- High confidence recommendations
- Clear uncertainty indicators where appropriate

### Completeness
- Cover all directories and file types
- Include hidden files and build artifacts
- Consider recent development patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Complete file inventory provided** with categorization
2. **Each recommendation includes clear rationale** 
3. **No critical application files flagged** for removal
4. **Files categorized by removal confidence** (safe/likely safe/uncertain)
5. **Analysis considers recent development context** from doc.md
