# ðŸ”’ SECURITY NOTICE - OAuth Client ID Removed

## âœ… SECURITY FIXES APPLIED

I've removed the exposed OAuth client ID from all public files that would be pushed to GitHub:

### Files Cleaned:
- âœ… `INSTALLATION-SIMPLE.md` - Removed explicit client ID
- âœ… `WORK-COMPUTER-TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Replaced with placeholder
- âœ… `FINAL-RELEASE-NOTES.md` - Removed explicit client ID
- âœ… `.specstory/` directory - Removed from git tracking (contained OAuth ID)
- âœ… `Sources/Unmissable/Config/Config.plist` - Removed from sources

### Security Status:
- âœ… `Config.plist` is properly gitignored
- âœ… OAuth client ID only exists in your local `Config.plist`
- âœ… App bundle still contains the OAuth config (works correctly)
- âœ… No sensitive credentials will be pushed to GitHub

## ðŸ“¦ SECURE FINAL RELEASE

**Package**: `Unmissable-Final-Release-SECURE.zip` (2.5MB)

### What's Secure:
- âœ… **OAuth Client ID**: Only in local Config.plist (gitignored)
- âœ… **App Bundle**: Contains OAuth config but not in repository
- âœ… **Documentation**: No exposed credentials
- âœ… **GitHub Safe**: Repository can be safely pushed public

### What Still Works:
- âœ… **Complete App**: Fully functional with OAuth
- âœ… **Google Calendar**: Authentication works perfectly
- âœ… **All Features**: Meeting reminders, overlays, etc.
- âœ… **Distribution**: App package ready for deployment

## ðŸš€ Safe to Push to GitHub

You can now safely:
1. Commit and push the cleaned repository
2. Make the repository public if desired
3. Share the code without exposing OAuth credentials
4. Distribute the app package (`Unmissable-Final-Release-SECURE.zip`)

The OAuth client ID remains functional in the distributed app but is not exposed in the source code.
