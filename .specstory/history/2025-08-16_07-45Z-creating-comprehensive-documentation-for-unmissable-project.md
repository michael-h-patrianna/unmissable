# Creating comprehensive documentation for Unmissable project (2025-08-16 07:45Z)

_**User**_

goal is to create a document that describes all important functional and technical details of this project, so that an llm coding agent can easily understand how to work in this project and add or change functionality. do a full review of this project and create a doc.md with this documentation. target audience is an llm coding agent running claude sonnet 4. does not have to be human-readable. usecase: in the future i will ask a new coding agent to first read the doc.md to understand what this project is and how the code works, to then add new functions or change existing functionality or to debug and fix a bug.

**STEP 0 - ROUTER**
✓ Not already working on a task
✓ Request not in blocklist
Proceeding to STEP 1.

**STEP 1 - CREATE FILES** **STEP 2 - EXECUTE PHASES**

## PHASE 1: UNDERSTAND & PLAN ## PHASE 2: IMPLEMENT SOLUTION 
```

```
Let me read more source files to understand the full architecture before creating the comprehensive documentation. Now I'll create the comprehensive documentation. 
```

```
## PHASE 3: VALIDATE & ITERATE 
```

```
**Done**

I have successfully created a comprehensive `doc.md` file that provides complete technical documentation for the Unmissable macOS application. The documentation is specifically designed for LLM coding agents like Claude Sonnet 4 and includes:

**Key Sections Covered:**

1. **Project Overview** - Core concept, purpose, and architecture
2. **Directory Structure** - Complete source organization with explanations
3. **Dependencies** - All Swift Package Manager dependencies and their purposes
4. **Data Models** - Complete Swift data structures with relationships
5. **Architecture Patterns** - Dependency injection, observables, state management, error handling
6. **Key Services** - Detailed explanations of all major service classes and their responsibilities
7. **OAuth2 Flow** - Complete authentication process with Google Calendar
8. **Google Calendar API Integration** - API endpoints, event processing, link extraction
9. **UI Architecture** - SwiftUI structure, overlay system, accessibility
10. **Testing Strategy** - Unit, snapshot, and integration testing approaches
11. **Build & Development** - VS Code setup, build commands, code quality
12. **Runtime Behavior** - Performance, error handling, multi-display support
13. **Privacy & Security** - Data handling, permissions, security measures
14. **Extension Points** - How to add new features and providers
15. **Debug & Troubleshooting** - Common issues and development tools

**LLM-Specific Features:**

- Technical implementation details over user documentation
- Code examples and data structures
- Clear service dependencies and relationships
- Database schema with SQL
- API integration patterns
- Error handling strategies
- Testing approaches with specific file locations
- Build and development workflows

The documentation captures all critical aspects of the codebase architecture, making it possible for an LLM coding agent to understand the project structure, modify existing functionality, add new features, and debug issues without human guidance.

we do not need anything about vscode setup. the agent will work in this project here in vscode.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll remove the VS Code setup information from the documentation since the LLM agent will already be working within VS Code. 
```

```
The VS Code setup section has been successfully removed from the documentation. The documentation now focuses purely on the technical aspects needed for an LLM coding agent to work with the project, without any VS Code installation or configuration instructions since the agent will already be working within the VS Code environment.
