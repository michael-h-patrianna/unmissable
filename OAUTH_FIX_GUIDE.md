# üîß Fix OAuth 2.0 Policy Error - Step by Step

## ‚ùå Error: "This app doesn't comply with Google's OAuth 2.0 policy"

This error occurs when the OAuth consent screen isn't properly configured. Here's how to fix it:

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Steps

### 1. Configure OAuth Consent Screen

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **OAuth consent screen**

### 2. Basic Information (Required)

Fill in these **required** fields:

**App Information:**
- **App name**: `Unmissable`
- **User support email**: Your email address
- **App logo**: (Optional, but helps with verification)

**App domain** (Important for compliance):
- **Application home page**: `https://github.com/michael-h-patrianna/unmissable`
- **Application privacy policy link**: `https://github.com/michael-h-patrianna/unmissable/blob/main/PRIVACY.md`
- **Application terms of service link**: `https://github.com/michael-h-patrianna/unmissable/blob/main/TERMS.md`

**Authorized domains**: (Leave empty for now)

**Developer contact information:**
- **Email addresses**: Your email address

### 3. Scopes Configuration

1. Click **Add or Remove Scopes**
2. Add these specific scopes:
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`
3. Click **Update**

### 4. Test Users (For Development)

1. Click **Add Users**
2. Add your email address and any other test users
3. Click **Save**

### 5. OAuth Client ID Configuration

1. Go to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **Credentials**
2. Click on your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
3. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add:
   - `com.unmissable.app://oauth/callback`
   - `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob`
   - `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` (for testing)

## üéØ Quick Fix for Immediate Testing

If you need to test immediately, try this simpler approach:

### Option 1: Use Publishing Status "Testing"

1. In OAuth consent screen, set **Publishing status** to **Testing**
2. Add your email to **Test users**
3. This allows you to bypass verification for testing

### Option 2: Create Simple Privacy Policy

Create a simple privacy policy file:

```markdown
# Privacy Policy for Unmissable

Unmissable is a calendar management application that:

- Accesses your Google Calendar in read-only mode
- Stores calendar data locally on your device
- Does not share your data with third parties
- Does not track user behavior

Data collected:
- Calendar events and meeting information
- Google account email for identification

Contact: your-email@example.com
```

Upload this to GitHub or your website and use the URL in the OAuth consent screen.

## üîç Verify API Enablement

Make sure these APIs are enabled:

1. Go to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **Library**
2. Search and enable:
   - **Google Calendar API**
   - **Google+ API** (for user info)

## üß™ Test the Fix

After making these changes:

1. Wait 5-10 minutes for changes to propagate
2. Clear your browser cache/cookies for Google
3. Try the OAuth flow again in your app
4. You should see a warning screen but with an option to continue

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Expected Behavior During Development

Even with proper configuration, you'll see:

```
"Google hasn't verified this app"
[Advanced] ‚Üí "Go to Unmissable (unsafe)"
```

This is normal for unverified apps. Click **Advanced** ‚Üí **Go to Unmissable (unsafe)** to continue.

## üöÄ For Production (Later)

To remove the warning completely:

1. Submit app for verification (requires domain ownership)
2. Complete security assessment
3. This can take weeks/months for approval

## üîß Alternative: Desktop Application Type

If issues persist, try changing the OAuth client type:

1. Delete current OAuth client
2. Create new one with **Application type**: **Desktop application**
3. Use the new client ID in your app

## üìù Common Issues

### "redirect_uri_mismatch"
- Add all redirect URIs listed above
- Make sure there are no trailing spaces

### "unauthorized_client"
- Verify client ID is copied correctly
- Check that APIs are enabled

### "access_denied"
- User needs to be added to test users
- Check OAuth consent screen configuration

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

After fixing, you should see:
1. OAuth consent screen shows your app name
2. User can grant permissions (even with warning)
3. Browser redirects back to your app
4. App shows "Connected" status
